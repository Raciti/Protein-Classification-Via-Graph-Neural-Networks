# Protein Classification Via Graph Neural Networks

## Insertion
The purpose of this thesis is to classify proteins based on their internal morphology, therefore their sequence of amino acids.

## Background

### Amino acids
Sono una vasta categoria di molecole organiche che hanno sia il gruppo funzionale amminico sia quello carbossilico

### Chains of amino acids
Amino acid chains are referred to as peptides and can contain a very variable number of units

### Protein
Proteins are made up of several amino acids connected to each other, typically we talk about 300 or more amino acids

### Graphs
Graphs are mathematical models that allow you to encode the interactions between the components of a complex system

### Neural Networks
They are a switching model composed of artificial neurons, used for the resolution of artificial intelligence problems

### GNN
A class of neural networks that processes data that can be represented in the form of graphs
